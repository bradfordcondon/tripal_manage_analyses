This module is for implementation of custom fields etc for the Staton lab HWG.

Note that in general, we don't need this module.  Fields can be added via the libraries folder if the module is set to 'tripal_chado'.

Splitting of analyses is now handled via [Tripal Alchemist](https://github.com/statonlab/tripal_alchemist/)
